This project is about representing your own day using Finite State Machines.
I started with creating an FSM model to make a strcuture of future code and make it more clear to implement.

Here we can see day description. Day could contain work out or not, but breakfast is mandatory. After that i study most of time, but if amount of deadlines is not worthy no worries, i could have a walk with friends. During studies i usually have a lunch and after few hours i go home. There i could spent time with family or watch anime, but, as i said, i study most of the time. When i am ran out of energy day is over and i go to sleep.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To try this code you can open **day_simulation.py** file and uncomment an example. 
If you wanna try it by your example you need to create your own student and start execution by **start_simulation()** method in DaySimulation class.
You create a object of it or use already creted one.
